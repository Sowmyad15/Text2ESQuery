# Text2ESQuery
Text2ESQuery is a project that simplifies querying in Elasticsearch by translating natural language queries into Elasticsearch query language. It enhances user experience and query accuracy through Prompt Engineering techniques, making Elasticsearch more accessible to a wider range of users. The system accepts natural language queries, converts them into precise ES queries, executes them against the Elasticsearch database, and presents relevant sample records in a clear, organized manner. It also provides visualizations to aid in understanding the retrieved data. Text2ESQuery's unique approach to simplifying NoSQL database querying sets it apart from similar systems designed for SQL databases, like LangChain's SQL Database Module. It showcases the potential for leveraging large language models (LLMs) for simplifying querying processes in various NoSQL databases beyond just Elasticsearch.
